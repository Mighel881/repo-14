		<version>1.2-b2</version>
		<change>Partially fixed an annoying issue where the status bar and notch cover wouldn’t be there while the device was locked. This would cause a “flash” when unlocking the device. Now, only the status bar is gone while the device is locked, getting rid of the “flash”.</change>
